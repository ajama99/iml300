The rave scene in Los Angeles began to emerge in the late 80’s, during what is now known to be the First Wave of raves in the city. The scene at this time was small and localized, but planted the seeds for what would become a rave movement in L.A. Beginning in 1996 in concurrence with a nationwide expansion of rave communities, the Second Wave of raves in L.A positioned Southern California as being the core of American raving culture, and interest in the scene, as well as its talent, began to explode.
</p>
<p>
At this time Los Angeles experienced a significant influx of DJs and electronic music artists, which, for rave-goers, provided a plethora of parties to choose from on any given weekend. In the throngs of it all was Michael Tullberg, a now acclaimed music journalist and photographer who, at the time, was enthralled by what he was seeing. Coming from a club photography background, as he describes, made him accustomed to a sort of nightlife hierarchy that was not present in the newfound rave scene. 
</p>
<p>
“Rather than putting forth an elitist, velvet rope sort of atmosphere … the rave scene instead created a warm, embracing, welcoming vibe that brought people in rather than keeping them out,” Tullberg recalled. “It was inclusive instead of being exclusive. The normal clubbing issues of race, sexuality, class, money, generational separation and the like were tossed out the window.”
</p>
<p>
In the following decades, the scene would undergo drastic changes as it transitioned from its underground origins to permeate more mainstream spaces and audiences. The Third Wave of raves in L.A, which began in 2004 and lasted until around 2020, was characterized by the emerging popularity of EDM. As this genre aligned more closely with pop music, this wave’s defining artists such as Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Deadmau5 and Diplo began achieving feats that very few L.A DJ’s had done in the 90’s, namely raking in hundreds or thousands of dollars per performance. Another defining trait of the Third Wave, according to Tullberg, was the shift in the type of venue that dominated nightlife. 
</p>
<p>
“By this time, big clubs like Avalon and Vanguard had established themselves as party destination, which made the old rave underground less necessary as a result,” said Tullberg. “One of the reasons why the rave underground had established itself so successfully in the first place was the face that the mainstream venues wouldn’t allow rave quality music within their doors. Now this was no longer the case, which gave the clubs ascendancy over the raves at this point in time.”
