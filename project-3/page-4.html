In Los Angeles, the thrill of a night out depends on uncertainty. Fun happens in the absence of plans, when calendars are left unmarked and caution is thrown to the wind.If a rave is your destination on a nighttime excursion in L.A, it is wise to surrender yourself to chance, mystery, and a great deal of radio silence, as for one, you likely will have no idea where you are going until 30 minutes before it starts. 
</p>
<p>
Once you have arrived at the venue, even the fact of your arrival is up for question, as raves in the city rarely make themselves visible to the public. If you drove to the rave, you must factor in the time you will spend driving ‘round and ‘round downtown L.A’s endless stretch of industrial complexes and abandoned warehouses, as the event you are looking for is probably in one of them. If you’ve been dropped off by rideshare, you will definitely be just as lost and panicked, but on foot. Now is the time to follow the noise, a suggestion that, in a city known for its sights, seems ill advised. 
</p>
<p>
But if you heed this advice and let the sounds of downtown at 3 a.m. guide you, you will eventually find what you’ve been looking for: blinding, multicolored LED’s, the baseline of electronic beats blaring through gargantuan speakers, and gaggles of rave-goers with styles ranging from Mad Max-leaning to 2007 goth reminiscent and “blokecore,” amongst many other things. You can shut off Google Maps now. 
</p>
<p>
The rave scene in Los Angeles began to emerge in the late 80’s, during what is now known to be the First Wave of raves in the city. The scene at this time was small and localized, but planted the seeds for what would become a rave movement in L.A. Beginning in 1996 in concurrence with a nationwide expansion of rave communities, the Second Wave of raves in L.A positioned Southern California as being the core of American raving culture, and interest in the scene, as well as its talent, began to explode. 
</p>
<p>
At this time Los Angeles experienced a significant influx of DJs and electronic music artists, which, for rave-goers, provided a plethora of parties to choose from on any given weekend. In the throngs of it all was Michael Tullberg, a now acclaimed music journalist and photographer who, at the time, was enthralled by what he was seeing. Coming from a club photography background, as he describes, made him accustomed to a sort of nightlife hierarchy that was not present in the newfound rave scene. 
</p>
<p>
“Rather than putting forth an elitist, velvet rope sort of atmosphere … the rave scene instead created a warm, embracing, welcoming vibe that brought people in rather than keeping them out,” Tullberg recalled. “It was inclusive instead of being exclusive. The normal clubbing issues of race, sexuality, class, money, generational separation and the like were tossed out the window.”
</p>
<p>
In the following decades, the scene would undergo drastic changes as it transitioned from its underground origins to permeate more mainstream spaces and audiences. The Third Wave of raves in L.A, which began in 2004 and lasted until around 2020, was characterized by the emerging popularity of EDM. As this genre aligned more closely with pop music, this wave’s defining artists such as Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Deadmau5 and Diplo began achieving feats that very few L.A DJ’s had done in the 90’s, namely raking in hundreds or thousands of dollars per performance. Another defining trait of the Third Wave, according to Tullberg, was the shift in the type of venue that dominated nightlife. 
</p>
<p>
“By this time, big clubs like Avalon and Vanguard had established themselves as party destination, which made the old rave underground less necessary as a result,” said Tullberg. “One of the reasons why the rave underground had established itself so successfully in the first place was the face that the mainstream venues wouldn’t allow rave quality music within their doors. Now this was no longer the case, which gave the clubs ascendancy over the raves at this point in time.”
</p>
<p>
While the underground remained dormant throughout the next few years of the Third Wave, it by no means died out. In reality, the underground origins of L.A’s rave scene are being rethought and revitalized by a new generation.
</p>
<p>
When Jonathan D’Aguilar first began exploring L.A’s rave scene, isolation seemed to define their experiences. Being one of the few Black people in the spaces that they were in was difficult enough, but feeling exploited by non-Black individuals in these spaces who would take D’Aguilar’s picture to, as D’Aguilar felt, achieve a “diversity push for their Instagram page” made the scene feel all the more uncomfortable for them at the time. 
</p>
<p>
These experiences motivated them to create their own unique nightlife experience, one in which marginalized individuals could truly “let loose, have fun, and enjoy music, people, and community.” Thinking beyond fulfilling people’s basic desires of safety and fun when going out, D’Aguilar wanted this new collective to allow patrons of the nightlife community to feel comfortable expressing their fullest selves, the selves that they may not be able to embody in their day to day lives. Thus, the name of D’Aguilar’s collective, Mystique Digitized, was born.
</p>
<p>
“The idea behind it [Mystique Digitized] came about by wanting to basically let people embrace their ideal self image and share that with the world,” D’Aguilar explained. “[We’re] kind of envisioning the ideal self, like an avatar version if you could just be rid of all like, essentially your genetics and all of that that you can’t control, like your gender identity and all of that.”
</p>
<p>
For Gbenga Komolafe, the midway point of their college career marked a turning point for their artistic expression. In addition to being a multimedia artist, they had always had a keenness for music that drove them to seek out events and concerts promoting dance and techno DJs. After a few of their friends picked up DJing, Komolafe was enticed to give the medium a try, and gradually began learning the ropes. It quickly became a passion, and an activity whose most valuable takeaway was the community it introduced them to. 
</p>
<p>
“It [the DJ community] really feels like a church where you meet with your people and just feel the spirit of the music, and forget about all of the bullshit from the week,” said Komolafe. “There’s something about a dancefloor that’s transcendental, and being given control over that is one of the highest honors. Being a DJ is like leading worship.”
</p>
<p>
While Komolafe feels some frustration at the lack of infrastructure around dance music in L.A, they value the experimentation that comes with this.
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes the warehouse raves get old and you want to just dance at a bar with seats and an actual bathroom … I feel like this lack of infrastructure, compared to New York City, Miami, and Europe gives a lot more freedom and there’s more points of entry with lower barriers for Djs and partners alike,” they said.
</p>
<p>
While Komolafe and D’Aguilar can identify several issues that plague L.A’s rave space, the most pervasive problem they both believe exists in the community is sexual assault. Despite its commonplace nature in nightlife, it has yet to receive significant attention. 
</p>
<p>
Fighting to change how sexual assault is addressed and prevented in nightlife is Four4Consent, a nonprofit organization that works to educate event organizers in nightlife on creating safer environments and a more positive culture at their events.
</p>
<p>
“Believe, educate, and empower are the primary principles [of Four4Consent] and we operate on a feeling of hope for a better future,” said Kay Brown, the founder of Four4Consent. 
</p>
<p>
An inciting incident that catalyzed the creation of Four4Consent was the revelation of sexual abuse by Bassnectar, a once titan of EDM, against two minor women. The lawsuits against Bassnectar that resulted from his assaults shook the EDM world, and motivated Brown and their peer and later colleague at Four4Consent Becca Tieder to address the nuances of the situation that weren’t being addressed. 
</p>
<p>
“After the article Becca and I co-authored on Bassnectar did nearly 15,000 unique views in 24 hours, there was a tangible need that was so visible to us,” said Brown. At the time, we were the only ones talking about the specific dynamics around what had been brought forward, but more surprisingly the reason that he was taking a step back.”
</p>
<p>
While eradicating the threat of sexual assault at nightlife events requires deep systemic change starting from the ground up, Brown recognizes the value of educating rave and club goers on how to protect themselves on a night out. 
</p>
<p>
“Check on the promoters that are in charge of the shows,” Brown advises. “Ones that don't book women, queer or Black and brown artists often time shave large gaps in safety measures. Also if it's a bunch of the same type of people at the top there is a hidden set of bias baked in, where they think a lot of issues that don't personally impact them don't exist.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy Nyguyen came to the rave scene with the hopes that it would be a change of pace from the club scene that he had become accustomed to in L.A. When he first started going out in the city during his early college years, the spaces that he was exploring had a tendency to exclude those without a network or following. This motivated Nguyen to seek out underground spaces such as Ham on Everything and Heav3n, more alternative collectives that felt like a departure from L.A’s run-of-the-mill clubbing scene.
</p>
<p>
“I came mainly for the music. A lot of the DJs I follow would be performing at these underground events,” recalled Nguyen. “Overtime, I fell in love with the people and the ‘feel’ of these underground parties that tend to go all night into the early morning.”
</p>
<p>
Just as the newfound community of underground rave spaces inspired D’Aguilar to create Mystique Digitized, Nguyen was moved to develop his own nightlife business following his introduction into the underground scene. Guided by a desire to throw events centered around his own music preferences, Nguyen assembled a group of friends who supported his concept and got to work.
</p>
<p>
The formation of his nightlife entertainment service Intercom Presents did not come without hurdles, however. In addition to the expected challenges that accompany self-funding and finding an audience to serve, Nguyen and his colleagues struggled to break through an industry in which your success largely depends on who you know. 
</p>
<p>
“It’s hard trying to put every piece of the puzzle together considering we had no industry connections, so it was just us emailing and making calls and attending a bunch of events out of our own pockets to try to make these connections,” said Nguyen. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to the nightlife industry’s high barrier to entry, Nguyen also finds fault with the industry, particularly the rave scene’s lack of advocacy surrounding safe drug use.
</p>
<p>
“I think for events that go extremely late until morning, there will be usage of drugs whether the promoter and or venue condones it or not,” said Nguyen. “It is better to have these test kits and proper drug education available for customers to prevent anything unfortunate from happening.”
</p>
<p>
Nguyen isn’t alone in his frustrations surrounding drug use at events. Tee Harris, an advocate for harm reduction at Los Angeles raves, feels that promoters need to be doing more to protect their patrons from overdosing. To advocate for the safety of rave patrons in the context of drug use, Harris created Rave Safe L.A, an organization that provides “safe ways to party with fentanyl testing strips to test their party favors and narcan in case people overdose.”
</p>
<p>
Despite Harris’ efforts to educate rave-goers and the general public on harm reduction, criticisms against Rave Safe L.A are still made under the basis that the organization promotes drug use. This, according to Harris, couldn’t be further from the truth.
</p>
<p>
“We are actually providing safety, and safe drug use and education around drug use and how you can better equip yourself when emergencies happen,” said Harris.
</p>
<p>
Like any movement in the music sphere, it is difficult to say how the resurgence of underground raves in Los Angeles will play out in the coming years. In 2022, interest in L.A raves seems to be driven in part by the popularity of hyperpop and its subgenres, as well as the general reawakening of the city’s nightlife scene following COVID-19 restrictions being lifted. 
</p>
<p>
Given the efforts of collectives such as Mystique Digitized and Intercom Presents, who have made it their mission to provide intersectional experiences at their events, it does not seem like excitement for L.A’s underground rave scene will wane anytime soon. Whatever direction Los Angeles’ nightlife space shifts in during the next few decades, it feels almost certain that there will forever be communities of outsiders and misfits who find peace in a scene that celebrates difference. In the end, the music will lead them to it.
