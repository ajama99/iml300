While one can identify several issues that plague L.A’s rave space, the most pervasive problem that exists in the community is sexual assault. Despite its commonplace nature in nightlife, it has yet to receive significant attention. 
</p>
<p>
Fighting to change how sexual assault is addressed and prevented in nightlife is Four4Consent, a nonprofit organization that works to educate event organizers in nightlife on creating safer environments and a more positive culture at their events.
</p>
<p>
“Believe, educate, and empower are the primary principles [of Four4Consent] and we operate on a feeling of hope for a better future,” said Kay Brown, the founder of Four4Consent. 
</p>
<p>
An inciting incident that catalyzed the creation of Four4Consent was the revelation of sexual abuse by Bassnectar, a once titan of EDM, against two minor women. The lawsuits against Bassnectar that resulted from his assaults shook the EDM world, and motivated Brown and their peer and later colleague at Four4Consent Becca Tieder to address the nuances of the situation that weren’t being addressed. 
</p>
<p>
“After the article Becca and I co-authored on Bassnectar did nearly 15,000 unique views in 24 hours, there was a tangible need that was so visible to us,” said Brown. At the time, we were the only ones talking about the specific dynamics around what had been brought forward, but more surprisingly the reason that he was taking a step back.”
</p>
<p>
While eradicating the threat of sexual assault at nightlife events requires deep systemic change starting from the ground up, Brown recognizes the value of educating rave and club goers on how to protect themselves on a night out. 
</p>
<p>
“Check on the promoters that are in charge of the shows,” Brown advises. “Ones that don't book women, queer or Black and brown artists often time shave large gaps in safety measures. Also if it's a bunch of the same type of people at the top there is a hidden set of bias baked in, where they think a lot of issues that don't personally impact them don't exist.”
</p>
<p>
In addition to the nightlife industry’s sexual assault problem, there is also fault to be found with the rave scene’s lack of advocacy surrounding safe drug use.
</p>
<p>
Tee Harris, an advocate for harm reduction at Los Angeles raves, feels that promoters need to be doing more to protect their patrons from overdosing. To advocate for the safety of rave patrons in the context of drug use, Harris created Rave Safe L.A, an organization that provides “safe ways to party with fentanyl testing strips to test their party favors and narcan in case people overdose.”
</p>
<p>
Despite Harris’ efforts to educate rave-goers and the general public on harm reduction, criticisms against Rave Safe L.A are still made under the basis that the organization promotes drug use. This, according to Harris, couldn’t be further from the truth.
</p>
<p>
“We are actually providing safety, and safe drug use and education around drug use and how you can better equip yourself when emergencies happen,” said Harris.
