In Los Angeles, the thrill of a night out depends on uncertainty. Fun happens in the absence of plans, when calendars are left unmarked and caution is thrown to the wind. If a rave is your destination on a nighttime excursion in L.A, it is wise to surrender yourself to chance, mystery, and a great deal of radio silence, as for one, you likely will have no idea where you are going until 30 minutes before it starts. 
</p>
<p>
Once you have arrived at the venue, even the fact of your arrival is up for question, as raves in the city rarely make themselves visible to the public. If you drove to the rave, you must factor in the time you will spend driving ‘round and ‘round downtown L.A’s endless stretch of industrial complexes and abandoned warehouses, as the event you are looking for is probably in one of them. If you’ve been dropped off by rideshare, you will definitely be just as lost and panicked, but on foot. Now is the time to follow the noise, a suggestion that, in a city known for its sights, seems ill advised. 
</p>
<p>
But if you heed this advice and let the sounds of downtown at 3 a.m. guide you, you will eventually find what you’ve been looking for: blinding, multicolored LED’s, the baseline of electronic beats blaring through gargantuan speakers, and gaggles of rave-goers with styles ranging from Mad Max-leaning to 2007 goth reminiscent and “blokecore,” amongst many other things. You can shut off Google Maps now. 
</p>

When Jonathan D’Aguilar first began exploring L.A’s rave scene, isolation seemed to define their experiences. Being one of the few Black people in the spaces that they were in was difficult enough, but feeling exploited by non-Black individuals in these spaces who would take D’Aguilar’s picture to, as D’Aguilar felt, achieve a “diversity push for their Instagram page” made the scene feel all the more uncomfortable for them at the time. 
</p>
<p>
These experiences motivated them to create their own unique nightlife experience, one in which marginalized individuals could truly “let loose, have fun, and enjoy music, people, and community.” Thinking beyond fulfilling people’s basic desires of safety and fun when going out, D’Aguilar wanted this new collective to allow patrons of the nightlife community to feel comfortable expressing their fullest selves, the selves that they may not be able to embody in their day to day lives. Thus, the name of D’Aguilar’s collective, Mystique Digitized, was born.
</p>
<p>
“The idea behind it [Mystique Digitized] came about by wanting to basically let people embrace their ideal self image and share that with the world,” D’Aguilar explained. “[We’re] kind of envisioning the ideal self, like an avatar version if you could just be rid of all like, essentially your genetics and all of that that you can’t control, like your gender identity and all of that.”
</p>

For Gbenga Komolafe, the midway point of their college career marked a turning point for their artistic expression. In addition to being a multimedia artist, they had always had a keenness for music that drove them to seek out events and concerts promoting dance and techno DJs. After a few of their friends picked up DJing, Komolafe was enticed to give the medium a try, and gradually began learning the ropes. It quickly became a passion, and an activity whose most valuable takeaway was the community it introduced them to. 
</p>
<p>
“It [the DJ community] really feels like a church where you meet with your people and just feel the spirit of the music, and forget about all of the bullshit from the week,” said Komolafe. “There’s something about a dancefloor that’s transcendental, and being given control over that is one of the highest honors. Being a DJ is like leading worship.”
</p>
<p>
While Komolafe feels some frustration at the lack of infrastructure around dance music in L.A, they value the experimentation that comes with this.
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes the warehouse raves get old and you want to just dance at a bar with seats and an actual bathroom … I feel like this lack of infrastructure, compared to New York City, Miami, and Europe gives a lot more freedom and there’s more points of entry with lower barriers for Djs and partners alike,” they said.

Jimmy Nyguyen came to the rave scene with the hopes that it would be a change of pace from the club scene that he had become accustomed to in L.A. When he first started going out in the city during his early college years, the spaces that he was exploring had a tendency to exclude those without a network or following. This motivated Nguyen to seek out underground spaces such as Ham on Everything and Heav3n, more alternative collectives that felt like a departure from L.A’s run-of-the-mill clubbing scene.
</p>
<p>
“I came mainly for the music. A lot of the DJs I follow would be performing at these underground events,” recalled Nguyen. “Overtime, I fell in love with the people and the ‘feel’ of these underground parties that tend to go all night into the early morning.”
</p>
<p>
Just as the newfound community of underground rave spaces inspired D’Aguilar to create Mystique Digitized, Nguyen was moved to develop his own nightlife business following his introduction into the underground scene. Guided by a desire to throw events centered around his own music preferences, Nguyen assembled a group of friends who supported his concept and got to work.
</p>
<p>
The formation of his nightlife entertainment service Intercom Presents did not come without hurdles, however. In addition to the expected challenges that accompany self-funding and finding an audience to serve, Nguyen and his colleagues struggled to break through an industry in which your success largely depends on who you know. 
</p>
<p>
“It’s hard trying to put every piece of the puzzle together considering we had no industry connections, so it was just us emailing and making calls and attending a bunch of events out of our own pockets to try to make these connections,” said Nguyen.
